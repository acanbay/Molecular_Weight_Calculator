1. Write the relevant values of the molecules whose distances and masses you know into input.txt.
2. Write the distance measurements of molecules whose masses you do not know into search.txt.
3. Run the MW_Calc program.
    * For Windows, double click MW_Calc.exe.
    * For Linux, run the
  
            ./MW_Calc
